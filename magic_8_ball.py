"""The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.
Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.
Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?

We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

    Yes - definitely
    It is decidedly so
    Without a doubt
    Reply hazy, try again
    Ask again later
    Better not tell you now
    My sources say no
    Outlook not so good
    Very doubtful

The output of the program will have the following format:

[Name] asks: [Question]
Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]

For example:

Joe asks: Is this real life?
Magic 8-Ball's answer: Better not tell you now

Let’s get started!
